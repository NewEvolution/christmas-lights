# Exercise: Christmas Lights

### To display this code locally:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install _http-server_ with `npm install -g http-server`
- Post cloning the project, run `http-server` in the project directory, and make note of the URL
- Navigate to that url in your web browser of choice
- Open up the javascript console in your browser to view the default tree
- Call `xmas(<number>, <true/false>)` with the number of your choice to display a tree of that height. The second value controls whether the tree is displayed upside down or not.

### The Challenge:

  Create an `xmas` function that accepts an integer as an argument. The function should create a Christmas tree out of asterisks in the browser console. The height is whatever is passed as an argument to the function.

  Example output with argument value of 5

            *
           ***
          *****
         *******
        *********
